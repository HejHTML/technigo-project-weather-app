- If you had more time, what would be next?
Correcting lang: en/se where it's not working properly. Or just go with english version.
I want to dig deeper into JavaScript and learn more. Now I understand what it does when I read code, but sometimes it's still hard to know what to write where in code to get functionality and clean code.
I would like to make this project again with my own design. I think it's a really good task to learn a lot about development. My students with autism would like an app that tells them what to wear instead of what temp it is. Maybe I can make a site with clothing suggestions in pictures.
